PERFORMANCE-ORIENTED ANALYSIS:
    ## 🔍 Key Questions We'll Answer:

        1. **Which variants are fastest?** → Lead time analysis
        2. **Which variants are most efficient?** → Cycle time efficiency
        3. **Where do patients wait the most?** → Waiting time by variant
        4. **Are complex variants slower?** → Correlation between length and performance
        5. **Which resources handle problematic cases?** → Resource-variant patterns
    ## 📊 Analysis Approach

        We'll perform **multi-level analysis**:

        1. **Case-Variant Mapping** → Link each patient to their specific variant
        2. **Data Integration** → Merge variants with performance metrics
        3. **Variant Performance Profiling** → Calculate statistics per variant
        4. **Comparative Analysis** → Identify best and worst performers
        5. **Visualization** → Make patterns visible and actionable
    ## 💡 Why This Matters

        In healthcare:
        - **Fast variants** = efficient treatment protocols
        - **Slow variants** = potential bottlenecks or complications
        - **High waiting time** = patient dissatisfaction and safety risks
        - **Low efficiency** = wasted resources and capacity

Important to add into the documentation :

    "Due to the event log containing only completion timestamps (not separate
    start/complete times), we cannot directly measure activity processing times.
    Therefore, we apply two complementary approaches:
    
    1. Lead Time Analysis: Measures total elapsed time (objective)
    2. Estimated Cycle Time: Uses domain-informed duration estimates (subjective)"
